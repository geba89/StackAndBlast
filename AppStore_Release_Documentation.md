## 1. App Store Metadata

### App Name (30 characters max)

```
Stack & Blast: Block Puzzle
```
(26 characters)

**Rationale:** "Stack & Blast" is the brand identity. "Block Puzzle" captures the primary search intent for the casual puzzle audience. Stays well under the 30-character limit.

### Subtitle (30 characters max)

```
Match, Chain & Combo to Win
```
(27 characters)

**Rationale:** Highlights core mechanics (matching, chaining, combos) and uses action verbs. No keyword overlap with the app name. Communicates the strategic depth beyond a simple block puzzle.

**Alternative subtitles (for A/B testing via Product Page Optimization):**

| Option | Text | Characters |
|--------|------|-----------|
| A | Match, Chain & Combo to Win | 27 |
| B | Color Match Cascade Puzzles | 27 |
| C | Addictive Color Blast Puzzles | 29 |

---

## 2. App Description

(4,000 characters max — the copy below is ~2,900 characters)

```
Drop blocks. Build groups. Blast them off the board.

Stack & Blast is a puzzle game with a twist: when same-color blocks form a big enough group, they detonate — and every surrounding block gets pushed outward. One blast triggers another, combos multiply your score, and the board reshuffles with every explosion. It's easy to learn but impossible to put down.

THREE WAYS TO PLAY

Classic Mode
No timer, no pressure. Place pieces from a tray of three, build same-color clusters, and trigger blasts. The catch? The blast threshold rises as your score climbs — so the better you play, the harder it gets. How far can you go?

Daily Challenge
60 seconds. Same puzzle for every player, worldwide. The pieces are identical for everyone each day, so the leaderboard is pure skill. Come back tomorrow for a fresh challenge.

Blast Rush
90 seconds on the clock, but every blast adds 5 more. Chain reactions keep the timer alive. Play fast, think ahead, and ride the combos as long as you can.

THE PUSH MECHANIC

This is what makes Stack & Blast different. When a group blasts, adjacent blocks don't just disappear — they get pushed away. Pushed blocks can collide with others, creating chain reactions. Blocks shoved off the edge are gone for good. Every move reshapes the board.

POWER-UPS

A special block spawns every 8 pieces. Trigger it in a blast to unleash its effect:

- Row Blast: Wipes an entire row clean
- Column Blast: Clears a full column top-to-bottom
- Color Bomb: Removes ALL blocks of one color from the board

CASCADING COMBOS

When a blast pushes blocks into new matching groups, a cascade begins. Each cascade level doubles your score multiplier. The audio builds with every level — a single ping becomes a full chord. Chase the chain.

YOUR BOARD, YOUR RULES

Pick your grid size: 8x8 for intense, tight play or 12x12 for sprawling strategic setups. 9x9 and 10x10 sit in between. Blast thresholds scale automatically.

UNLOCK 6 VISUAL THEMES

Earn new block skins by playing: Neon, Pastel, Retro, Monochrome, and the elusive Galaxy theme. No purchases required — every skin is unlocked through gameplay milestones.

BUILT FOR COMFORT

- Colorblind mode with unique shape symbols on every block
- Haptic feedback you can feel on every placement and blast
- Procedurally-generated audio with warm, satisfying tones
- All settings toggleable: sound, haptics, accessibility
- Dark theme throughout — easy on the eyes

BOMB CONTINUE

Game over? Watch a short video to drop a bomb that clears a 6x6 area. Pick your target, blast through the clutter, and keep your run alive.

TRACK YOUR PROGRESS

Lifetime stats show total games played, blasts triggered, pieces placed, best combo, and highest single-game score. High scores are tracked per mode.

Download Stack & Blast and find out how long you can keep the chain going.
```

**Key design choices:**
- First 3 lines (before "Read More" truncation) deliver the hook + unique selling point
- Bulleted features are scannable for quick browsing
- No keyword stuffing — iOS descriptions aren't search-indexed; this is purely conversion copy
- Ends with a challenge-based CTA ("find out how long") rather than a generic "download now"

## 11. App Review Notes

### Review Notes for Apple

```
Stack & Blast is a single-player puzzle game with no user accounts
or social features. Gameplay is entirely offline except for optional
rewarded video ads served via Google AdMob.

AD TESTING:
The app uses Google AdMob rewarded video ads. The ad is triggered
when the player taps the "USE BOMB" button on the game over screen.
To test: start a Classic game, fill the grid until game over occurs,
then tap "USE BOMB" to trigger the rewarded ad flow.

INTERNET REQUIREMENT:
The main menu disables game mode buttons when no internet connection
is detected. This is because the rewarded ad system requires
connectivity to pre-load ads. The game itself runs entirely offline
once a game session has started.

No login or account creation is required. No in-app purchases.
```

### Demo Account
Not applicable — no login system.

### Attachment Notes
None required.
